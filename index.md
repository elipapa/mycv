## Work

`Oct2020 - now`
__Director AI Engineering, [AstraZeneca](http://www.astrazeneca.com)__

`Oct2018 - Oct2020`
__AI & Data Science Lead, [AstraZeneca](http://www.astrazeneca.com)__

- Fast-paced hiring to kickstart and scale an AI team within R&D IT.
- Leading separate teams dedicated to:
  - using BERT language-based models in NLP to extract relationship from biomedical literature
  - build a large-scale knowledge graph with internal data
  - pilot the use of graph learning representation and graph ML for target identification, repurposing and recommender systems.

I was hired to build a Data Science team focussed on building and exploiting knowledge graphs for target recommendations. Our aim is to make the job of the drug discovery scientist faster and more successful using AI/Machine learning and robust data science tools.
Joining a large corporation, it was imperative to build the right "maker" culture where the team could be given the autonomy to start small, build things fast and scale them. In less than six months, I rewrote the interview process, established new ways of working and directly contributed code to new projects. The team is now more than 15 people, regularly releasing the results of machine learning pipeline for the use of our scientists and participating in pipeline decisions. I learned a lot: from how to train NLP transformer models to interviewing effectively, managing data science projects in an applied research setting and run projects at scale.


`Feb2017 - Oct2018`
__Senior Data Scientist, Translational Advanced Analytics, [Biogen](http://www.biogen.com)__

`Feb2016 - Feb2017`
__Manager, Digital Health Technology & Data Science, [Biogen](http://www.biogen.com)__

Concurrent projects:

1) Advanced analytics & scientific computing

I employ my knowledge of machine learning, python and data engineering architecture to deliver production-grade analysis pipeline to Biogen's computational biology group, statistical genetics group and early discovery groups.
This includes models based on RF, SVM, xgboost (scikit-learn), vowpal wabbit applied on biomarker and genomics data, as well as applied deep learning approaches (Keras, Tensorflow) applied on MEDLINE data (22m records) plus clinical trial literature and data.

2) [Open Targets](http://www.opentargets.org) liaison

Working on computational biology and genomics analysis which leverage large scale human data sets with the goal of identify and prioritize new drug targets.
Manage and influence Open Targets scientific program, working in partnership with the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, the European Bioinformatics Institute, and GSK. This work has resulted in several collaborations approved and funded by Open Targets that benefit Biogen.
I routinely represent Biogen externally, including speaking invitations at informatics and scientific venues.

3) Development of the [Open Targets Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org)

I am one of the team lead, responsible to plan and manage the work of 2 Biogen and 4 EBI engineers including weekly planning and engineering duties.
I manage the long-range planning and decision-making, including creating and owning the de facto Open Targets informatics platform roadmap, and making sure the team adopts the tool and process. This has directly resulted in new features important to Biogen in 2016’s Open Targets informatics platform releases.

4) Biogen's principal liaison for the  and [Genomics England discovery forum](https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/working-with-industry/)

Participated and contributed to the Genomics England GENE consortium together with VPs and Directors from AZ, GSK, Takeda, Abbvie, Alexion and others.
